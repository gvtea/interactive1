          <p>iScribble was a collaborative website where people had the
          ability to chat and draw with others in real time, across the globe.</p>
          <p>Private and public boards were accessible to people to visit and draw on,
          but private boards were exclusive to invites,so there was an incentive
          to make friends with others to be included in these spaces.</p>

           <span id="some-element2">
            The site went offline in the fall of 2018, but is currently being
            renovated and rebranded.
