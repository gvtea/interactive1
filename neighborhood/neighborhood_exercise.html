  <h1>Sign Hill Park</h1>
  <p>The park is known for its hillside letters that say
    <br>"South San Francisco
        The Industrial City"
    </br>
    <br> With many hiking trails that loop around with a view of Colma, Daly City, the airport, and the San Bruno Mountains, it is breathtaking to visit.

  <h1> Spruce Cafe </h1>
    <p><br>Tucked away at a slight intersection on El Camino Real is this small, contemporary cafe nestled at a
       corner of a residential street, Spruce.
      <br>They sell a variety of sweet and savory pastries and, of course, lattes of many flavors.

      <h1> Never Too Latte </h1>
        <p><br>Right down a street of what is essentially a line of small restaurants,
           Never Too Latte humbly sits next to a laundromat. Much like Spruce, they also sell lattes; hence its name.
