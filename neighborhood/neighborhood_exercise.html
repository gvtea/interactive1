  <h1> South San Francisco </h1>

  <p>
  A relatively small city located north of San Bruno and to the south of Colma and Daly City.
  It is nicknamed <i>South City</i> to locals, much like San Francisco is simply called <i>The City.</i>
  There are many condensed neighborhoods that weave into each other and aren't as well explored as
  I have fond memories of the the places that I chose within these specific neighborhoods--they are
  Downtown, Oyster Point, and Sign Hill.

  <h1>Downtown</h1>
    <h2 id="cafe">Spruce Cafe</h2>
      <p><br> Tucked away at a slight intersection on El Camino Real is this small, contemporary cafe nestled by the
       corner of a residential street, Spruce. They sell a variety of sweet and savory pastries and, of course, lattes of many flavors.
       I had always wanted to spend time outside of my room drawing people in a cafe but have
       felt too self conscious to do so alone. When I came here with my friends, I felt more comfortable doing so.

      <a id= "cafe2" </a>
        <h2> Bunn Mi Cafe </h2>
          <p> This cafe is along Grand Avenue, which is a street known to host many restuarants and family-owned stores
            in such a small area. It's close to a street corner so it isn't easy to miss and the smell of freshly baked bread
            will draw you in!

          <a id= "burrito" </a>
            <h2> Taqueria La Morena </h2>
              <p> As you could probably guess by the name, La Morena offers Mexican comfort food that is cheap and delicious.
                  The service is pretty fast and efficient even though it does get loud, the cozy and casual atmopshere can distract you
                  from the bustle of people walking in. This place was always a go-to for my parents and I when I was younger and we'd
                  go on picnics by Oyster Point Marina while we enjoy our food and the crashing of the ocean waves.
                  They have this slight rivalry with another restaurant not too far from it called La Tapatia, but the competition isn'<table>
                  too impressive
                  </table>

  <h1>Sign Hill</h1>

  <a id= "hillside" </a>
    <h2>Sign Hill Park</h2>
    <p>The park is known for its hillside letters that spell out
      <br>"South San Francisco
          The Industrial City"
      </br>
      <br> With many hiking trails that loop around with a view of Colma, Daly City, the airport, and the San Bruno Mountains, it is breathtaking to visit.

    <h1>Oyster Point</h1>
      <p><br> Oyster Point Marina gets its name from the neighborhood it's in,
        which is--drum roll--Oyster Point!
