  <h1> South San Francisco </h1>

  A relatively small city located north of San Bruno and to the south of Colma and Daly City.
  It is nicknamed <i>South City</i> to locals, much like San Francisco is simply called <i>The City.</i>
  There are many condensed neighborhoods that weave into each other and aren't as well explored as

  <h1>Neighborhoods</h1>
  <p> I have fond memories of the the places that I chose within these specific neighborhoods; they are
      Downtown, Oyster Point, and Sign Hill.
  </p>

  <h2>Downtown</h2>
  <a id= Cafe </a>
    <h1> Spruce Cafe </h1>
      <p><br> Tucked away at a slight intersection on El Camino Real is this small, contemporary cafe nestled by the
       corner of a residential street, Spruce. They sell a variety of sweet and savory pastries and, of course, lattes of many flavors.
       I had always wanted to spend time outside of my room drawing people in a cafe but have
       felt too self conscious to do so alone. When I came here with my friends, I felt more comfortable doing so.

  <h2>Sign Hill</h2>

  <a id= Hillside</a>
    <h2>Sign Hill Park</h2>
    <p>The park is known for its hillside letters that spell out
      <br>"South San Francisco
          The Industrial City"
      </br>
      <br> With many hiking trails that loop around with a view of Colma, Daly City, the airport, and the San Bruno Mountains, it is breathtaking to visit.
